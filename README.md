<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Polygon, formerly known as Matic Network, is a blockchain scalability platform 
and framework for connecting and building blockchain networks compatible
with Ethereum. The real value of Polygon NFTs lies in their potential to 
transform the way markets function and enhance the way we manage and control sensitive information.
This is the main idea behind this project to showcasewhat's actually happening inside the market in terms 
of NTF transactions, new collections, unique wallets, so that people can start utilizing 
polygon in  a better way by looking at the stats from our dashboard.

## Usage

The chain polygon is covered in this application with general information and predictions.
Volume exchanges per day, unique wallets per day, collection-wise unique wallets and volume, and 
so on are all included in the forecast. This will provide a clear statistic to NFT traders and buyers. 
As a result, they will be able to invest according to market conditions. This also provides a graphical view of 
how the chain works over time and how the market fluctuates.

* The home page represents the total volume and wallet prediction across the chain polygon by line chart and includes a few key metrices 
like Total volume, Average daily volume, and Average weekly volume. 

* The collection page depicts  the overall volume and wallet prediction across all collections in the chain polygon by line chart; for example, 
we've provided a few key metrics and predictions of volume and wallet over the period of time for Chicken Derby. The metrices includes total volume, average daily volume, and average weekly volume.

* The Token page displays a list of unique tokens, tokens that are frequently traded, tokens that are sold in large quantities, and so on. 
We've also included the current owner of the token id, as well as the characteristics of the Top 4 most sold tokens by volume throughout each collection.

* The wallet page displays a list of unique wallets, as well as the top seller by volume, tokens top seller by volume, and total transactions, 
among other information. We've also compiled a list of the top 100 wallet-to-wallet transactions in the chain polygon.

* Duplicate page shows the duplicate tokens by providing key such as token id as the input.

* The state page includes all of the collectios across the chain polygon, along with the market cap, transaction count, and floor price,etc.
